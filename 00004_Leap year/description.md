Define the function `isLeapYear`. A year is leap if it is a multiple of 400, or it is a multiple of 4 but not of 100.


```haskell
ãƒ  isLeapYear 2000
True
```

Remember you can use the function `multiple` that takes two arguments and says if the first argument is a multiple of the second argument.
